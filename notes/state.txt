    Props Vs State

    Props                                               State
        ->  get passed to component                         ->  is managed within component
                                            
                                            Analogy
        
        ->   function parameters                            ->  variables declared inside function body

        ->  props are IMMUTABLE                             ->  state can be CHANGED

        ->  props      -- in functional component           ->  useState Hook -- in functional component
            
            this.props -- in class component                    this.state    -- in class Component
