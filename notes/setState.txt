        NOTE:below rules can be clarified by using 'Counter' Component as Example


        ->  always make use of setState and never modify the state directly.

            ->  ex: DON'T DO THIS

                    this.state.count=this.state.count+1;
                    console.log(this.state.count);
            
                    this increments count value in console but React does not increment counter value in UI

        ->  if the code has to be executed after state has been updated,
            place the code in the callback function which is the
            second arguement to the setState method.

            ->  ex: DO THIS

                    this.setState({ 
                        ....,
                        ()=>{console.log(this.state.count);
                        })


        ->  when you have to update state based on the previous state value,
            pass the function as the arguement instead of regular object

            ->  ex:DON'T DO THIS

                    this.increment();
                    this.increment();
                    this.increment();
                    this.increment();
                    this.increment();
                    console.log(this.state.count);
