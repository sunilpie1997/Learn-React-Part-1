Javascript XML (JSX)
    ->  extension to javascript language syntax.

    ->  write XML like code for elements and components

    ->  JSX tags have a tag name,attributes and children

    ->  IT IS NOT A NECESSITY TO WRITE REACT APPLICATIONS

    ->  JSX makes your React code simpler and elegant

    ->  It ultimately transpiles to pure Javascript which is understood by browsers.


    JSX Differences:
        class -> className
        for -> htmlFor

        camelcase property naming convention:
            onclick -> onClick
            tabindex -> tabIndex
