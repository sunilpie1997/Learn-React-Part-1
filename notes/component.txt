    Components
        ->  reusable part of user interface.
        ->  can be divided into 2 types:

            ->  functonal Components
                ->   Simple Javascript fumctions
                
            ->  Class Component
                ->  class extending Component class
                ->  must contain render() method


WHICH TO CHOOSE AND WHEN?

    Functional Component
                                 |---------------------|
        ->  properties --input-->| Javascript function | ---output-->HTML (JSX)
                                 | can also have state,|
                                 | after hooks update  |
                                 | in 2018             |
                                 |---------------------|

        ->  can also have state and lifecycle hooks after 'React' update in 2018

        ->  CAN BE USED when rendering basic UI (NO COMPLEX LOGIC)

        ->  absence of 'this' keyword

        ->  ex:Greet.js

    
    Class Component
                                   |------------------|
        ->  properties  --input--> | ES6 Class        |  --output--> HTML (JSX)
                                   |                  |
                                   | private internal |
                                   | STATE            |
                                   |------------------|

        ->  more feature rich.

        ->  maintain their own private data state

        ->  complex UI logic

        ->  Provide lifecycle hooks

        ->  presence of 'this' keyword

        ->  ex:Welcome.js
