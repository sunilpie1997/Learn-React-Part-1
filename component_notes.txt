    Components
        ->  reusable part of user interface.
        ->  can be divided into 2 types:

            ->  Stateless functonal Components
                ->   Simple Javascript fumctions
                
            ->  Stateful Class Component
                ->  class extending Component class
                ->  must contain render() method


WHICH TO CHOOSE AND WHEN?

    Functional Stateless Component
                                 |---------------------|
        ->  properties --input-->| Javascript function | ---output-->HTML (JSX)
                                 |---------------------|
        ->  USE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

        ->  Absence of 'this' keyword

        ->  Solution without STATE ---no complex logic

        ->  stateless/presentational/dumb

        ->  ex:Greet.js

    
    Class Stateful Component
                                   |------------------|
        ->  properties  --input--> | ES6 Class        |  --output--> HTML (JSX)
                                   |                  |
                                   | private internal |
                                   | STATE            |
                                   |------------------|

        ->  more feature rich.

        ->  maintain their own private data state

        ->  complex UI logic

        ->  Provide lifecycle hooks

        ->  stateful/smart/container

        ->  ex:Welcome.js
